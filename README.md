# Multiclass Classification Baselines for Anomaly-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems 

This repository contains jupyter notebooks for applying machine learning classification algorithms for enhancements in Network Intrusion Detection Systems.

## ASNM-TUN.ipynb
This notebook contains the Malware NIDS baselines using neural networks, decision trees, random forests, and support vector classifiers.

## EDA.ipynb
This notebook contains the compilation of the profile of the attributes in the dataset.

## FFS.ipynb
This notebook contains the select features used for the baselines using Forward Feature Selection with cross validation.
